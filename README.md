# Tumor-Stage-Prediction

# Abstract
We are studying the prediction of tumor stage of breast
cancer using machine learning (ML). Through the data
collected from 2509 patients, multiple machine learn-
ing algorithms are applied for the tumor stage pre-
diction of the breast cancer by considering the most
influential histopathology parameters, aiming to help
doctors to better decide the procedure and treatment
for that patient. Random Forest was utilized for fea-
ture selection and neural network is mainly applied for
predicting model. We found that the algorithm has an
accuracy of approximately 88.6%
